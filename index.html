        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is John Doe, and I am a <sup>2</sup>nd year computer science student at XYZ University. I have a strong interest in web development and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and exploring new places.</p>
        <p>I am currently working on a project that involves using machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices. This project has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning and its potential applications in the real world. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field.</p>
